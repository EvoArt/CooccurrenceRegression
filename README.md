### Future plans

The current implementation depends on [`Turing.jl`](https://turinglang.org/) and [`Mooncake.jl`](https://chalk-lab.github.io/Mooncake.jl/stable/), so install times are not as quick as they could be. I aim to streamline the package in the near future.

Depending on the level of interest, I will include additional model structures and options e.g. hierarchical models and splines.
